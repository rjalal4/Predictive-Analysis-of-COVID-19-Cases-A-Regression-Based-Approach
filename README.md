# Predictive-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Cases-A-Regression-Based-Approach
This project explores the relationships between confirmed COVID-19 cases, recoveries, new cases, and deaths across multiple countries using regression models. By applying linear and multiple linear regression techniques, the study aims to assess the predictive power of different factors in understanding the progression of the pandemic. Various data analysis techniques, including cross-validation, are employed to evaluate model performance. The findings provide insights into the effectiveness of regression models in pandemic data analysis and highlight the limitations of certain predictive approaches.
